coursework code for web design 2

The following code will start a server that the user can comunicate with in the url, 
it returns 3 results a landing page, the exercises page that show exercises to be completed and the delete page which serve to confirm the deletion of an exercise.

the landing page performs a function that adds 2 database entries when the page loads to show the functionality that data can be added to the database on command.

the exercise page performs a function that finds and returns all database entries and displays them on screen for the user to view in the browser.

The delete page performs a function that will delete any entry with the exercise 'run' attached to it, 
it displays a message on screen telling the user that the entry has been deleted.

when the user returns to the exercise page there will only be one entry for 'lift weights' as the other exercise has been deleted.

the code will also handle errors by displaying a 404 error message when a request cannot be returned.
